# Miniproject

Installation:
You need to install the entire project by clicking the green "clone or download" button and download the project as a zip file. 
After extracting the files from the zip go to the directory "//debug/x64/client" and "//debug/x64/server" and open the server.exe
and client.exe in that order. 

How to use:
Once both the server and client is running, you can press enter in the server terminal to start two new threads that make poems.
When that is done the game of rock/ paper/ scissors will start. Here the client types one of the options and then waits for the 
server to type one of the options. When both have choosen the winner is decided and they can play again.
